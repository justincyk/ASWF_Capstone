Once a player has played and inputted 5 of their matches, they will receive a ranking in comparison with other players using the leaderboard application. This ranking is calculated using the ELO Ranking algorithm. Once a player receives a ranking, not only are they able to see their past matches by viewing their profile, they will be able to see how their ranking has changed based on each match. Additional features will be added.
